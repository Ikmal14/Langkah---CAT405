Also with the present of cryptocurrency, we can say the finance industry are emerging providing more types of currency that rely on different types of market than flat currencies. Also with the helps of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, there are many possibilities that can be done, from helping the clients, to making decisions for business in finance sectors.
